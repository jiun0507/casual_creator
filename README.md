# Build a castle
This is a interactive program using processing language.

## What is a castle?
We all are given blocks in our lives. And life is what you make of it. I wanted a very simple building block which one can use to build something completely on their own. 

## How do we share it with others?
Use cmd + shift + 4 to screen capture the screen of the castle you built!

# Build a castle

This is a interactive program using processing language.

## What is a castle?

We all are given blocks in our lives. And life is what you make of it. I wanted a very simple building block which one can use to build something completely on their own.

## How to interact?

click on the screen and it will create a block.

## Personally

I love the clause "life is what you make of it". We are all given blocks to build our castle throughout our lives. One may use the blocks to create something fanxy. Other may create strong foundation. Use your imagination to show something creative!

## Challenge

I never really worked on interactive developing before. I usually worked on requests and responses. But this interactive developing was much more interactive and I had to think in terms of frames that go by in miliseconds.

## How do we share it with others?

Use cmd + shift + 4 to screen capture the screen of the castle you built!
